The game's gameplay and mechanics received mixed reactions from reviewers. Some of the positive aspects of the gameplay were the variety of ways to complete a mission, the freedom of choice and exploration, and the creative use of disguises and weapons. Game Informer wrote that "the game offers a wealth of options for completing each mission, whether you want to go in guns blazing, sneak around unnoticed, or anything in between".[36] GameSpot praised the game's "smart level design" and "rewarding stealth gameplay".[41] IGN wrote that "the game's best moments come from experimenting with your tools and abilities, finding clever ways to eliminate your targets".[40]
  
Some of the negative aspects of the gameplay were the inconsistent AI, the linear and scripted segments, and the lack of challenge and replay value. Eurogamer wrote that "the game's AI is erratic and unreliable, sometimes spotting you from across the map, sometimes failing to notice a dead body at their feet".[38] Edge wrote that "the game's linearity and scripting often undermine its stealth mechanics, forcing you to follow a predetermined path or triggering events regardless of your actions".[39] PC Gamer wrote that "the game's difficulty is too easy, even on the highest settings, and the game lacks the incentive to replay missions and try different approaches".[42]
  
The game's online mode, Contracts, received generally positive reviews from critics. Contracts allows players to create their own custom missions by choosing a level, a target, a weapon, and other parameters, and then share them with other players. Game Informer wrote that "Contracts mode is a brilliant addition that adds tons of replay value and encourages creativity".[36] GameSpot wrote that "Contracts mode is a fun and challenging way to test your skills and compete with others".[41] IGN wrote that "Contracts mode is a great way to extend the game's longevity and share your own assassination scenarios with the world".[40]
