- The movie was based on a novel by Jon Cleary, who was disappointed by the film adaptation and felt that it could have been one of the great adventure films of all time[^1^].
- The movie was originally intended to star Steve McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset, but McQueen died before the production began[^1^].
- The movie was frequently perceived by the film-going public as being a knock-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), when in fact the film had been in development since the late 1970s[^1^]. Interestingly, Tom Selleck auditioned for the part of Indiana Jones and one can see his screen test on the DVD for that movie. Selleck was locked into a tight shooting schedule for Magnum, P.I. (1980) which is why he was unable to star in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). As that movie was a blockbuster hit, Avventurieri ai confini del mondo is considered to have been offered to Selleck for compensatory reasons and also because he had been the original choice to play the Indiana Jones character[^1^].
- The names of Patrick O'Malley's two bi-planes were Dorothy and Lillian. These were named after two silent screen actresses, the sisters Dorothy Gish and Lillian Gish[^1^].
- The make and models of the three bi-planes in the film were all vintage Belgian-designed French-built Stampe SV4C aircraft that were built after World War II though in the film the planes portray World War I era bi-planes[^1^].
- Actors Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong had to overcome a significant height difference between them whilst blocking their scenes together. Armstrong is quoted in the January 1984 edition of Photoplay (UK) magazine as saying: "I spent five months in four-inch heels and standing on soap boxes just to reach him"[^1^].
- Actress Bess Armstrong once said of her co-star Tom Selleck whilst doing publicity for the picture: "He is real gorgeous, and he has some real power now, but he doesn't use that, or his charm, to exploit women. He genuinely seems to like women. For an actor, that's rare"[^1^].
- The movie features a song called Charleston, written by Cecil Mack and James P. Johnson, which was a popular dance tune in the 1920s[^2^].

As you can see, Avventurieri ai confini del mondo is not only a great adventure movie, but also a fascinating piece of cinema history. If you want to learn more about this movie, you can visit its IMDb page[^2^] or its Wikipedia page[^4^]. You can also watch some clips and trailers on YouTube or other video platforms.
