## Recording Multiple Payments
 
One of the new features of inFlow Inventory 2.5.1 is the ability to record multiple payments for a single order. This is useful for layaways or if a customer is making a deposit, for example. To apply a partial payment:
 
1. Open your order and click the "Paid" label at the bottom.
2. In the resulting window, enter the payment method, amount, and any other details you'd like to record.
3. Click "OK" to save the payment.

You can repeat this process as many times as needed until the order is fully paid. You can also view the payment history by clicking the "Paid" label again.
 
## Using Keyboard Shortcuts
 
inFlow Inventory 2.5.1 also includes many keyboard shortcuts to make your daily dealings easier to navigate. If you would like to know the shortcut for something, hover your mouse over the button to see a tooltip with the shortcut listed. For example, you can use Ctrl + N to create a new record, Ctrl + S to save the current record, or Ctrl + P to print or export documents related to the order.
 
For a full list of keyboard shortcuts, please refer to this blog post[^1^] by inFlow Inventory.
 
## Generating Historical Reports
 
The Historical Inventory Report will allow you to get the quantity and total cost value for your inventory as of a specific date. It can be found in the inventory reports section of the reporting module. You can use this report to see how your inventory levels and values have changed over time, or to prepare for tax season.
 
To generate a historical report:

1. Go to Main Menu > Reports > Inventory Reports > Historical Inventory Report.
2. Select a date range and a location for your report.
3. Click "Refresh" to see the results.

You can also export or print your report by clicking the buttons on the top right corner of the window.
